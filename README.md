# BeautyShop E-Commerce

## Description

This project is a simple full stack e-commerce cart application created during the DecodeLabs Internship.

It includes a responsive frontend interface and a backend API connected with a PostgreSQL database.  
The frontend shows beauty products and a shopping cart layout, while the backend provides APIs to fetch and add products.

# Task 1 — Responsive UI (Frontend)

In this task a responsive e-commerce cart interface was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The page contains:

- Navigation bar
- Product cart layout
- Quantity increase and decrease buttons
- Order summary section
- Footer section
- Responsive layout for mobile and tablet

### How to Check Task 1

Step 1  

Open the project folder.

Step 2  

Open the folder named:

project-1-responsive-ui

Step 3  

Open the file:

index.html

Step 4  

The BeautyShop UI will open in the browser.

You should see:

- BeautyShop navigation bar  
- Shopping cart items  
- Quantity + and - buttons  
- Order summary section  

If the UI loads correctly then **Task 1 is working**.

---

# Task 2 — Backend API (Node.js + Express)

In this task a backend API was created using Node.js and Express.

The backend provides APIs to:

- Get all products
- Add a new product

The backend runs on:

http://localhost:5000

---

## How to Run the Backend

Step 1  

Open terminal.

Step 2  

Go to the backend folder.

```
cd project-2-backend-api
```

Step 3  

Start the server.

```
node server.js
```

Step 4  

If the server starts successfully you will see:

Server running at http://localhost:5000

---

## How to Test GET API

Step 1  

Open browser.

Step 2  

Paste this URL:

```
http://localhost:5000/products
```

Step 3  

You should see product data like this:

```
[
 {"id":1,"name":"Lipstick","price":350},
 {"id":2,"name":"Powder","price":420},
 {"id":3,"name":"Sunscreen","price":480}
]
```

This means the backend API is working.

---

## How to Test POST API (Add Product)

Step 1  

Open **Postman**.

Step 2  

Select method:

POST

Step 3  

Paste this URL:

```
http://localhost:5000/products
```

Step 4  

Go to:

Body → raw → JSON

Step 5  

Paste this data:

```
{
"name":"Foundation",
"price":550
}
```

Step 6  

Click **Send**

Step 7  

You will see response like:

```
{
"id":4,
"name":"Foundation",
"price":550
}
```

Step 8  

Now open browser again and check:

```
http://localhost:5000/products
```

You will see the new product added.

If the product appears, then **Task 2 is working**.

---

# Task 3 — PostgreSQL Database Integration

In this task the backend API was connected to a PostgreSQL database so that product data is stored in the database instead of temporary memory.

The backend uses the **pg library** to connect Node.js with PostgreSQL.

Products are stored in a table named:

products

---

## How to Check Database Data

Step 1  

Open terminal.

Step 2  

Start PostgreSQL.

Step 3  

Open PostgreSQL CLI.

```
psql -U postgres
```

Step 4  

Connect to the database.

```
\c beautyshop
```

Step 5  

Check the products table.

```
SELECT * FROM products;
```

Step 6  

You should see product records stored in the database.

Example:

```
 id |   name      | price
----|-------------|------
 1  | Lipstick    | 350
 2  | Powder      | 420
 3  | Sunscreen   | 480
```

This confirms that the backend is successfully connected to PostgreSQL.

---

# Task 4 — Frontend and Backend Integration

In this task the frontend was connected with the backend API to create a complete full stack application.

Instead of using static product data in HTML, the frontend now fetches product data from the backend API using asynchronous requests (fetch API).

The data received from the backend is dynamically displayed on the UI. Basic error handling is also implemented to handle cases where the backend is not running.

---

## How to Check Task 4

Step 1  

Start the backend server.

```
cd project-2-backend-api
node server.js
```

Step 2  

Open the frontend.

Open:

project-1-responsive-ui/index.html

Step 3  

You should now see products loaded dynamically from the backend.

---

## Dynamic Data Test

Step 1  

Open **Postman**

Step 2  

Send POST request:

```
http://localhost:5000/products
```

Step 3  

Go to Body → raw → JSON

Step 4  

Paste:

```
{
"name":"Serum",
"price":600
}
```

Step 5  

Click **Send**

Step 6  

Now refresh the frontend page.

You should see the new product added.

---

## Error Handling Test

Step 1  

Stop the backend server.

Step 2  

Refresh the frontend.

Step 3  

You will see an error message like:

"error loading data"

This confirms error handling is working.
